This is a native (C based) audio player framework that implements the ickStream 
protocol and should be integratable on Linux based hardware.

Note that this is work in progress in alpha state, i.e. the code and even 
the underlying concept and architecture might and will change at any time!

Before configuring make sure that the following libs are installed in 
development version (i.e. including headers):
- libickstreamp2p (you should make this without the jansson sources, by "make JANSSONSRCS=")
- libjansson
- libcurl
- libuuid
- libasound (optional, recommended)
- libpulse  (optional)
- libmpg123 (optional, recommended)
- libFLAC   (optional)
- libcurses (optional, for hmi=NCurses)

Configure the package by running configure, e.g.
./configure
or
./configure debug hmi=Generic

Solve any missing dependencies by installing the libs mentioned above and 
rerun configure. 
Use "./configure help" for further options.

For the first run, select an audio device (run "ickpd -al" to list all devices).
Optionally select a network interface (if different from eth0):

cd daemon
./ickpd -ad "alsa:front:CARD=Device,DEV=0"
or
./ickpd -ad "alsa:front:CARD=Device,DEV=0" -i wlan0

Note: by default the device settings are persisted as part of the player state 
in the file ".ickpd_persist" and it is only necessary to set them once.
You can reset the player state by deleting that file.

Use "./ickpd -?" to find out how to set other parameters.

Send SIGINT (Ctrl-c) to gracefully shut down the player.

*************************************************************************
Extensions to the ickStream specifications:

Player protocol method "setPlayerConfiguration":
  parameter "accessToken" is optional
  resets and requests the list of cloud services
  (parameter "playerName" is still required)
  
Player protocol method "shuffleTracks" accepts optional parameters:
  playlistStartPos [i] - start of queue range to shuffle
  playlistEndPos [i]   - end of queue range to shuffle

Player protocol method "setRepeatMode" accepts additional mode:
  "REPEAT_ITEM" - repeat item under playback queue cursor
